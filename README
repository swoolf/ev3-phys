Under Development: 

Breif description.

A program that allows a use to program an EV3 by physically teaching it IF-THEN statements. 
The code is realtime displayed in a web site, hosted on the EV3. 

So far, it only works for a line follower program. So a robot would need two motors and one color sensor. 

First run serve.py to create a webserver that watches the index.html file. 
Then, run playing.py to begin programming the robot.
